#### Description:
TradeWise AI is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize the world of stock trading. In this README, I will explain how the website works and how to use it.

## Introduction
I'd like to introduce my CS50X final project, which revolves around the creation of a smart trading website. The primary aim of this project is to provide users with an intuitive platform for making informed decisions in the stock market. This README will guide you through the website's features, functions, and how to effectively utilize it for your trading endeavors.

## Getting Started
Firstly, you can access the homepage or the login page of the website. If you don't have an existing account, you also have the option to register on this website. Here's how the registration process works:

Click the registration option.
Provide your username, password, and confirm your password.
If you already have an account, you can simply log in to the website.

## Homepage and Features
Upon logging in, you'll be directed to the homepage, where you can see all of your holdings. The current balance is displayed on every page for your convenience. The website's user-friendly design ensures easy navigation, making it a seamless experience for both new and experienced traders.

## Trading Options
The navigation bar includes several options, each serving a specific purpose:

Buy: In this section, you can easily purchase stocks of your choice.
Sell: You can initiate the sale of your stocks, efficiently managing your portfolio.
History: This section provides a comprehensive view of your transaction history, allowing you to track your trading activities.
## Stock Details
When you're considering purchasing a stock, understanding its current price is crucial. The website offers a convenient code function that provides comprehensive details about stock prices and other relevant information. By clicking on a specific stock, you can access details such as its current price, name, and even view graphical representations of its price fluctuations throughout the day.

## AI Assistance
One of the standout features of this project is the integration of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to assist users in making sound trading decisions. The AI algorithm generates recommendations for:

The optimal time to hold the stock.
The right time to buy the stock.
The best moment to sell the stock.
By inputting the stock's name, users can tap into the AI's expertise, making informed choices to enhance their trading strategy.

## Streamlined Transactions
To buy a stock, navigate to the "Buy" section, select the desired stock, and make your purchase. The system will confirm the successful purchase. When you wish to sell a stock, select the stock, choose the quantity, and confirm the sale. A complete transaction history is readily available for your reference, enabling you to track your trading activities effectively.

## Portfolio
Lastly, your homepage also serves as your portfolio, where you can keep track of your holdings and monitor their performance. This feature provides a holistic view of your investments and offers insights to make informed decisions.

In conclusion, my smart trading website is designed to simplify the decision-making process for stock trading by utilizing AI algorithms to provide users with valuable insights and recommendations. It's a valuable tool for traders seeking to make informed choices and manage their portfolios effectively.

This revised description is broken down into multiple paragraphs, making it easier to follow and understand. It provides a more organized and structured presentation of your project's features and functionality.
